# umdio replacement scraper
UMD IO API WAS DOWN.... 

A class project required collecting course information for a particular semester and calculating the longest possible walk between classes.

We anticipated using umd.io but it was down.

Therefore I had to make my own web site scraper.....
# how to run
This program takes two arguments:
The season to look up (i.e. spring/fall) and the year. 

python3 ./scraper.py desired_season desired_year

It outputs a list of classes in JSON format.
